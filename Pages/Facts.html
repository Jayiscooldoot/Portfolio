    About me
    <p1 class="LG"><br>
    I am currently a junior at Rosemount High School, I am 16 years old, and I've been doing computer science for 3 years now. I moved to Minnesota at the age of 10 and have lived in Rosemount ever since. I am a varsity member of the rosemount bowling team (188 avg), I am currently JV for the trap team (15 avg), and I am on the robotics team. My favorite color is blue, favorite movie is San Andreas, my favorite actor is Dwayne the Rock Johnson, my favorite book is Ready Player One, but my favorite author is J.K. Rowling. I like to read (only good books), my favorite season is winter because thats when I can go skiing, I like to play video games with my friends, and I enjoy coding my own games for them to play.
